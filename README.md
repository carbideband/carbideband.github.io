#### The repository for Carbide's website

www.carbide.rocks is made possible by the following awesome projects & services:
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [FullPage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)'s [Minima Theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

Using Github as a host, requires only a domain name to be registered (if you even want a custom domain).
Caveat being that gh-pages only allows the use of static pages,
Fullpage.js allows the use of JavaScript to make Github's static pages a bit more versatile.
In our usecase, what we wanted was for users to be able to browse the webpage, without interrupting the music player.

Sidenote about Jekyll: It is a great way to make an exceptional static blog with little to no programming background
and their Minima theme is amazing.
It is great for just about any website (so long as you do some modifying).

Hope this helps out anyone else looking to create a website similar to ours.
